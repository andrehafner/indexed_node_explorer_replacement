# Docker Compose override for PARALLEL NODE fetching
#
# Usage:
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.multi-node.yml up -d
#
# This connects ergo-index to multiple public nodes for faster parallel syncing.
# Note: Public nodes may have rate limits or be occasionally unavailable.
